Just a simple PowerShell script that changes GTA V Enhanced version to modded or legit (online).

# How to use ?

Download the script (*Run GTA.ps1*) and move it anywhere.
Create a new text file with .bat at the end and copy-paste this script into your file :

```bat
@echo off
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "PathofScriptFile"
```

It's possible the script doesn't work because of the PowerShell version.
I recommend to use PowerShell 7 or highter.

Just be sure your GTA V modded directory is renamed to ***Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced M*** and your original Enhanced version to ***Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced O***.
